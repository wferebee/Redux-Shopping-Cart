&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Technologies Used
* React
* Redux
* React-Redux
* JavScript

* and deployed with GitHub Pages

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Running the App:
* Clone the repository to your computer
* npm install - will install the dependencies
* Or create your own react app and copy over the 'src' folder.
* npm start - to run the program locally

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Issues:
* Upon first opening the page, the bottom "add to cart button" and battery image are not the right size, I am looking into possible reasons for this problem. Upon first inspection, it appears it could be a rendering problem caused by windows 10 actually. Will look into further and fix ASAP.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Future Changes:
* Put components and their corresponding css files into their own folders just for orgainization.
* Slim down some of the css and make the responsiveness a little cleaner.
* Find out the exact color of yellow to use for the "add to shopping cart button" lol.
